# Movie Reccomendation System

Develop a recommendation system that clusters similar movies based on features such as genre, director, cast, writers etc. Using K-Means clustering, identify groups (clusters) of movies that have similar characteristics with similar preferences. Based on these clusters, recommend movies that a user is likely to enjoy based on their past interactions or by finding movies within the same cluster
